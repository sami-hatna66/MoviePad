# MoviePad

A Swift/UIKit application for writing notes whilst watching movies in full screen on MacOS. The application resides in the menu bar and can therefore be used in full screen without having to switch to a new desktop. Notes are saved in userdefaults when the user quits the application. The user can also choose between different colour schemes
